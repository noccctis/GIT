    <p><strong>Elian stood at the cliff’s edge</strong>, clutching the old lantern his grandmother had given him.
     The Festival of Lights blazed in the valley below, lanterns rising like sparks into the
      star-filled sky. Yet his lantern was different—its glass pulsed faintly, as though a
       star lived inside it. Tonight, he whispered, would be the night he discovered the 
       truth of the legend.

    <p>
        <h3><em>The lantern flared</em></h3>
    , and 
        <h4>before him unfolded a staircase of light</h4>
     climbing into the heavens. Trembling, Elian stepped forward. Above, wings shimmered like silver fire.
     The gates of Caelum awaited, and the city above the stars called his name.
